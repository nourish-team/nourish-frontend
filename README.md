## Intro
Nourish is a skincare tracking app designed to empower users in their skincare journey. 
Our goal is to provide a platform where users can journal and monitor the effectiveness of their skincare routine, helping them identify what products and combinations work best for them.

### About the project

With nourish, users can easily create their personalized skincare routine by searching for products by brand and adding them to their routine. 
To enhance customization, users have the option to include tags that describe the targeted skin type and the preferred weather conditions for the routine.

Once a routine is created, users can journal about their experiences by adding journal entries and even uploading photos of their skin.
These journal entries are stored in the user's history, allowing them to track progress and observe any changes over time.

In addition to personal tracking, nourish enables users to explore and engage with the routines of others. Users can browse through a collection of routines and like them.
Liked routines are conveniently saved for future reference, providing inspiration and allowing users to implement ideas from other skincare enthusiasts.

Nourish aims to be a comprehensive companion for skincare enthusiasts, fostering a community where users can learn from one another and make informed decisions about their skincare routine.
